			<h1>Kyounghee Lee is a graphic designer in Ottawa</h1>
			
			<p>Hello. My name is Kyounghee Lee. I am a Graphic Designer. Thank you for visiting. I hope you have fun in my world
            
            At an early age I was fortunate to discover my passion for art & design. Exploring my creativity through many different mediums, I focused & honed my artistic strengths to the services I provide my clients today.

I attended Canadore College of Applied Arts, graduating with a Diploma in Graphic Design Productions and a Certificate in Interactive Multimedia with academic honours. During my education I started my freelance business by participating in the Ministry of Economic Development & Trade Program, Summer Company.</p>
